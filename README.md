##  How to Use

1. Run `npx dbagent init`  
   → Initializes the agent with a shallow context of your project  
2. Run `npx dbagent "YOUR_QUERY_HERE"`  
   → Executes the query to create files, write, and update code accordingly

## 🧠 About This Project

This agent is **heavily prioritized on correctness and accuracy** when creating database schemas and backend API routes.  
The **second priority** is integrating correctly into the backend.  

Since it performs a **shallow scan** to save resources, it currently overlooks CSS and focuses on the core backend structure of the project.  
A **deep scan feature** will be introduced later to include frontend and build complete end-to-end functionality.

##  Engineering Highlight

The core innovation(well atleast to me) here is the **decision to store context locally** in the user's project root, instead of relying on the model's memory — which can run out.  
This allows the agent to re-use project understanding across multiple queries by sending context along each time.
